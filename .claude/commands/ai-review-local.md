# Local AI Code Review

Run a structured code review using the OpenAI Chat Completions API. Reviews changes
against the same methodology criteria used by the CI reviewer, but adapted for local
pre-PR use. Designed for iterative review/revision cycles before submitting a PR.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain optional flags:
- `--full-registry`: Include the entire REGISTRY.md instead of selective sections
- `--model <name>`: Override the OpenAI model (default: `gpt-5.4`)
- `--dry-run`: Print the compiled prompt without calling the API

## Constraints

This skill does not modify source code files. It may:
- Create a commit if there are uncommitted changes (Step 3)
- Create/update review artifacts in `.claude/reviews/` (gitignored)
- Write temporary files to `/tmp/` (cleaned up in Step 8)

Step 5 makes a single external API call to OpenAI. Step 3b runs a secret scan
before any data is sent externally.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the optional flags listed above. All flags are optional —
the default behavior (selective registry, gpt-5.4, live API call) requires no arguments.

### Step 2: Validate Prerequisites

Run these checks in parallel:

```bash
# Check API key is set (never echo/log the actual value)
test -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" && echo "API key: set" || echo "API key: MISSING"

# Check script exists
test -f .claude/scripts/openai_review.py && echo "Script: found" || echo "Script: MISSING"
```

If the API key is missing (and not `--dry-run`):
```
Error: OPENAI_API_KEY is not set.

To set it up:
1. Get a key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to your shell: echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...' >> ~/.zshrc
3. Reload: source ~/.zshrc
```

If the script is missing:
```
Error: .claude/scripts/openai_review.py not found.
This file should be checked into the repository.
```

Ensure the reviews directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/reviews
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes and Generate Diff

Determine the base branch (the repo's default branch, not the current branch's upstream):
```bash
base_branch=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name' 2>/dev/null || echo "main")
```

Check for uncommitted changes (modified, staged, or untracked):
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If there are uncommitted changes, commit them before proceeding:

1. Show the user what will be committed (the `git status --porcelain` output above)
2. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
3. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes. Follow the
   repository's commit message conventions (see recent `git log --oneline`).
4. Report: "Committed changes: <commit message> (<short sha>)"

If the commit fails (e.g., pre-commit hook), display the error and stop.

Generate diff and metadata:
```bash
git diff --unified=5 "${base_branch}...HEAD" > /tmp/ai-review-diff.patch
git diff --name-status "${base_branch}...HEAD" > /tmp/ai-review-files.txt
branch_name=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If the diff is empty, report:
```
No committed changes vs ${base_branch} to review.
```
Clean up temp files and stop.

### Step 3b: Secret Scan Before API Upload

Before sending any diff content to OpenAI, run the canonical secret scan patterns
(from `/pre-merge-check` Section 2.6) against the same diff range:

```bash
# Content pattern — search diff content, output filenames only (never echo secret values)
secret_files=$(git diff -G "(AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}|ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}|sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}|gho_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}|[Aa][Pp][Ii][_-]?[Kk][Ee][Yy][[:space:]]*[=:]|[Ss][Ee][Cc][Rr][Ee][Tt][_-]?[Kk][Ee][Yy][[:space:]]*[=:]|[Pp][Aa][Ss][Ss][Ww][Oo][Rr][Dd][[:space:]]*[=:]|[Pp][Rr][Ii][Vv][Aa][Tt][Ee][_-]?[Kk][Ee][Yy]|[Bb][Ee][Aa][Rr][Ee][Rr][[:space:]]+[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+|[Tt][Oo][Kk][Ee][Nn][[:space:]]*[=:])" --name-only "${base_branch}...HEAD" 2>/dev/null || true)

# Sensitive filename pattern
sensitive_files=$(git diff --name-only "${base_branch}...HEAD" | grep -iE "(\.env|credentials|secret|\.pem|\.key|\.p12|\.pfx|id_rsa|id_ed25519)$" || true)
```

If either `secret_files` or `sensitive_files` is non-empty, use AskUserQuestion:
```
Warning: Potential secrets detected in files that would be sent to OpenAI:
- <list filenames>

The diff containing these files is about to be transmitted to the OpenAI API.

Options:
1. Abort — review and remove secrets before retrying
2. Continue — I confirm these are not real secrets
```

If user selects abort, clean up temp files and stop. If continue, proceed.

### Step 4: Handle Re-Review State

If `.claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md` exists, preserve it for re-review context:
```bash
if [ -f .claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md ]; then
    cp .claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md .claude/reviews/local-review-previous.md
    echo "Previous review preserved for re-review context."
fi
```

### Step 5: Run the Review Script

Build and run the command. Include `--previous-review` only if the previous review file
exists from Step 4.

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/openai_review.py \
    --review-criteria .github/codex/prompts/pr_review.md \
    --registry docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md \
    --diff /tmp/ai-review-diff.patch \
    --changed-files /tmp/ai-review-files.txt \
    --output .claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md \
    --branch-info "$branch_name" \
    [--previous-review .claude/reviews/local-review-previous.md] \
    [--full-registry] \
    [--model <model>] \
    [--dry-run]
```

If `--dry-run`: display the prompt output and stop. Report the estimated token count
and model that would be used.

If the script exits non-zero, display the error output and stop.

### Step 6: Display the Review

Read and display the full contents of `.claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md`.

### Step 7: Offer Next Steps Based on Assessment

Parse the review output to determine the assessment:
- Look for patterns: `⛔` (Blocker), `⚠️` (Needs changes), `✅` (Looks good)
- Count severity labels: P0, P1, P2, P3

**If no findings at all** (clean review):
```
Review passed with no findings. Suggested next steps:
- /pre-merge-check — run local pattern checks
- /submit-pr — commit and open a pull request
```

**If any findings exist** (P0, P1, P2, or P3):

Use AskUserQuestion. Tailor the summary and recommendation to the severity:

For ⚠️ or ⛔ (P0/P1 findings):
```
The review found issues that need attention:
- N P0 finding(s) (blockers)
- N P1 finding(s) (needs changes)
- N P2/P3 finding(s) (minor/informational)

Options:
1. Enter plan mode to address findings (Recommended)
2. Re-run with --full-registry for deeper methodology context
3. Skip — I'll address these manually
```

For ✅ with P2/P3 findings only:
```
Review passed (no P0/P1 blockers), but there are minor findings:
- N P2 finding(s)
- N P3 finding(s) (informational)

Options:
1. Address P2 findings before submitting
2. Skip — proceed to /pre-merge-check and /submit-pr
```

**If user chooses to address findings**: Parse the findings from the review output.
The review context is already in the conversation. Start addressing the findings
directly — for P0/P1 issues use `EnterPlanMode` for a structured approach; for P2/P3
issues, fix them directly since they are minor.

After fixes are committed, the user re-runs `/ai-review-local` for a follow-up review.

### Step 8: Cleanup

```bash
rm -f /tmp/ai-review-diff.patch /tmp/ai-review-files.txt
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` not set (non-dry-run) | Error with setup instructions (see Step 2) |
| Script file missing | Error suggesting it should be checked in |
| No committed changes | Clean exit with message |
| Script exits non-zero | Display stderr output from script |
| Previous review file missing on re-run | Script warns and continues as fresh review |
| User aborts due to uncommitted changes | Clean exit |

## Examples

```bash
# Standard review of current branch vs main
/ai-review-local

# Review with full methodology registry
/ai-review-local --full-registry

# Preview the compiled prompt without calling the API
/ai-review-local --dry-run

# Use a different model
/ai-review-local --model gpt-4.1
```

## Notes

- This skill does NOT modify source files — it only generates temp files and
  review artifacts in `.claude/reviews/` (which is gitignored). It may also
  create a commit if there are uncommitted changes (Step 3).
- Re-review mode activates automatically when a previous review exists in
  `.claude/reviews/local-review-latest.md`
- The review criteria are adapted from `.github/codex/prompts/pr_review.md` (same
  methodology axes, severity levels, and anti-patterns) but framed for local
  code-change review rather than PR review
- The CI review (Codex action with full repo access) remains the authoritative final
  check — local review is a fast first pass to catch most issues early
- This skill pairs naturally with the iterative workflow:
  `/ai-review-local` -> address findings -> `/ai-review-local` -> `/submit-pr`
