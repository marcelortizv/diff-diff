# PreToolUse hook for ExitPlanMode: ensure a plan review exists before approval.
#
# Output protocol: PreToolUse hooks must output JSON to stdout and exit 0.
#   Allow: exit 0 (no output, or JSON with permissionDecision: "allow")
#   Deny:  exit 0 with JSON { hookSpecificOutput: { permissionDecision: "deny", ... } }
#   Error: exit 2 means hook error (not a deliberate block) — avoid this.
#
# Strategy:
#   1. Read ~/.claude/plans/.last-reviewed sentinel (written by review step)
#   2. If sentinel exists, use its contents as the plan path
#   3. If no sentinel, fall back to most recent .md in ~/.claude/plans/
#   4. Check for sibling .review.md — deny if missing
#
# Known limitations:
#   - The ls -t fallback (step 3) can pick the wrong plan if multiple files exist.
#   - A stale sentinel from a prior session can allow a new plan through unreviewed.
#   The CLAUDE.md guidance mitigates both by updating the sentinel on new plan creation.
#   - printf %s in deny() does not escape quotes/backslashes in $1. Plan file paths
#     almost never contain these characters. If needed later, add sanitization:
#     MSG=$(echo "$1" | sed 's/"/\\"/g')
#
# Dependencies: None (uses printf for JSON output, no jq required).

deny() {
  # Output JSON deny decision to stdout, then exit 0 (not exit 2)
  # Sanitize message: escape double quotes and backslashes for valid JSON
  local msg
  msg=$(printf '%s' "$1" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g; s/"/\\"/g')
  printf '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"%s"}}' "$msg"
  exit 0
