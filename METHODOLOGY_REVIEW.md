# Methodology Review

This document tracks the progress of reviewing each estimator's implementation against the Methodology Registry and academic references. It ensures that implementations are correct, consistent, and well-documented.

For the methodology registry with academic foundations and key equations, see [docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md](docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md).

---

## Overview

Each estimator in diff-diff should be periodically reviewed to ensure:
1. **Correctness**: Implementation matches the academic paper's equations
2. **Reference alignment**: Behavior matches reference implementations (R packages, Stata commands)
3. **Edge case handling**: Documented edge cases are handled correctly
4. **Standard errors**: SE formulas match the documented approach

## Detailed Review Notes

### Core DiD Estimators

#### DifferenceInDifferences

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Module | `estimators.py` |
| Primary Reference | Wooldridge (2010), Angrist & Pischke (2009) |
| R Reference | `fixest::feols()` |
| Status | **Complete** |
| Last Review | 2026-01-24 |

**Verified Components:**
- [x] ATT formula: Double-difference of cell means matches regression interaction coefficient
- [x] R comparison: ATT matches `fixest::feols()` within 1e-3 tolerance
- [x] R comparison: SE (HC1 robust) matches within 5%
- [x] R comparison: P-value matches within 0.01
- [x] R comparison: Confidence intervals overlap
- [x] R comparison: Cluster-robust SE matches within 10%
- [x] R comparison: Fixed effects (absorb) matches `feols(...|unit)` within 1%
- [x] Wild bootstrap inference (Rademacher, Mammen, Webb weights)
- [x] Formula interface (`y ~ treated * post`)
- [x] All REGISTRY.md edge cases tested

**Test Coverage:**
- 53 methodology verification tests in `tests/test_methodology_did.py`
- 123 existing tests in `tests/test_estimators.py`
- R benchmark tests (skip if R not available)

**R Comparison Results:**
- ATT matches within 1e-3 (R JSON truncation limits precision)
- HC1 SE matches within 5%
- Cluster-robust SE matches within 10%
- Fixed effects results match within 1%

**Corrections Made:**
- (None - implementation verified correct)

**Outstanding Concerns:**
- R comparison precision limited by JSON output truncation (4 decimal places)
- Consider improving R script to output full precision for tighter tolerances

**Edge Cases Verified:**
1. Empty cells: Produces rank deficiency warning (expected behavior)
2. Singleton clusters: Included in variance estimation, contribute via residuals (corrected REGISTRY.md)
3. Rank deficiency: All three modes (warn/error/silent) working
4. Non-binary treatment/time: Raises ValueError as expected
5. No variation in treatment/time: Raises ValueError as expected
6. Missing values: Raises ValueError as expected

#### MultiPeriodDiD

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Module | `estimators.py` |
| Primary Reference | Freyaldenhoven et al. (2021), Wooldridge (2010), Angrist & Pischke (2009) |
| R Reference | `fixest::feols()` |
| Status | **Complete** |
| Last Review | 2026-02-02 |

**Verified Components:**
- [x] Full event-study specification: treatment × period interactions for ALL non-reference periods (pre and post)
- [x] Reference period coefficient is zero (normalized by omission from design matrix)
- [x] Default reference period is last pre-period (e=-1 convention, matches fixest/did)
- [x] Pre-period coefficients available for parallel trends assessment
- [x] Average ATT computed from post-treatment effects only, with covariance-aware SE
- [x] Returns PeriodEffect objects with confidence intervals for all periods
- [x] Supports balanced and unbalanced panels
- [x] NaN inference: t_stat/p_value/CI use NaN when SE is non-finite or zero
- [x] R-style NA propagation: avg_att is NaN if any post-period effect is unidentified
- [x] Rank-deficient design matrix: warns and sets NaN for dropped coefficients (R-style)
- [x] Staggered adoption detection warning (via `unit` parameter)
- [x] Treatment reversal detection warning
- [x] Time-varying D_it detection warning (advises creating ever-treated indicator)
- [x] Single pre-period warning (ATT valid but pre-trends assessment unavailable)
- [x] Post-period reference_period raises ValueError (would bias avg_att)
- [x] HonestDiD/PreTrendsPower integration uses interaction sub-VCV (not full regression VCV)
- [x] All REGISTRY.md edge cases tested

**Test Coverage:**
- 50 tests across `TestMultiPeriodDiD` and `TestMultiPeriodDiDEventStudy` in `tests/test_estimators.py`
- 18 new event-study specification tests added in PR #125

**Corrections Made:**
- **PR #125 (2026-02-02)**: Transformed from post-period-only estimator into full event-study
  specification with pre-period coefficients. Reference period default changed from first
  pre-period to last pre-period (e=-1 convention). HonestDiD/PreTrendsPower VCV extraction
  fixed to use interaction sub-VCV instead of full regression VCV.

**Outstanding Concerns:**
- No R comparison benchmarks yet (unlike DifferenceInDifferences and CallawaySantAnna which
  have formal R benchmark tests). Consider adding `benchmarks/R/multiperiod_benchmark.R`.
- Default SE is HC1 (not cluster-robust at unit level as fixest uses). Cluster-robust
  available via `cluster` parameter but not the default.
- Endpoint binning for distant event times not yet implemented.
- FutureWarning for reference_period default change should eventually be removed once
  the transition is complete.

### Modern Staggered Estimators

#### CallawaySantAnna

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Module | `staggered.py` |
| Primary Reference | Callaway & Sant'Anna (2021) |
| R Reference | `did::att_gt()` |
| Status | **Complete** |
| Last Review | 2026-01-24 |

**Verified Components:**
- [x] ATT(g,t) basic formula (hand-calculated exact match)
- [x] Doubly robust estimator
- [x] IPW estimator
- [x] Outcome regression
- [x] Base period selection (varying/universal)
- [x] Anticipation parameter handling
- [x] Simple/event-study/group aggregation
- [x] Analytical SE with weight influence function
- [x] Bootstrap SE (Rademacher/Mammen/Webb)
- [x] Control group composition (never_treated/not_yet_treated)
- [x] All documented edge cases from REGISTRY.md

**Test Coverage:**
- 46 methodology verification tests in `tests/test_methodology_callaway.py`
- 93 existing tests in `tests/test_staggered.py`
- R benchmark tests (skip if R not available)

**R Comparison Results:**
- Overall ATT matches within 20% (difference due to dynamic effects in generated data)
- Post-treatment ATT(g,t) values match within 20%
- Pre-treatment effects may differ due to base_period handling differences

**Corrections Made:**
- (None - implementation verified correct)

**Outstanding Concerns:**
- R comparison shows ~20% difference in overall ATT with generated data
  - Likely due to differences in how dynamic effects are handled in data generation
  - Individual ATT(g,t) values match closely for post-treatment periods
  - Further investigation recommended with real-world data
- Pre-treatment ATT(g,t) may differ from R due to base_period="varying" semantics
  - Python uses t-1 as base for pre-treatment
  - R's behavior requires verification

**Deviations from R's did::att_gt():**
1. **NaN for invalid inference**: When SE is non-finite or zero, Python returns NaN for
   t_stat/p_value rather than potentially erroring. This is a defensive enhancement.

**Alignment with R's did::att_gt() (as of v2.1.5):**
1. **Webb weights**: Webb's 6-point distribution with values ±√(3/2), ±1, ±√(1/2)
   uses equal probabilities (1/6 each) matching R's `did` package. This gives
   E[w]=0, Var(w)=1.0, consistent with other bootstrap weight distributions.

   **Verification**: Our implementation matches the well-established `fwildclusterboot`
   R package (C++ source: [wildboottest.cpp](https://github.com/s3alfisc/fwildclusterboot/blob/master/src/wildboottest.cpp)).
   The implementation uses `sqrt(1.5)`, `1`, `sqrt(0.5)` (and negatives) with equal 1/6
   probabilities—identical to our values.

   **Note on documentation discrepancy**: Some documentation (e.g., fwildclusterboot
   vignette) describes Webb weights as "±1.5, ±1, ±0.5". This appears to be a
   simplification for readability. The actual implementations use ±√1.5, ±1, ±√0.5
   which provides the required unit variance (Var(w) = 1.0).

## Review Process Guidelines

### Review Checklist

For each estimator, complete the following steps:

- [ ] **Read primary academic source** - Review the key paper(s) cited in REGISTRY.md
- [ ] **Compare key equations** - Verify implementation matches equations in REGISTRY.md
- [ ] **Run benchmark against R reference** - Execute `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --estimator <name>` if available
- [ ] **Verify edge case handling** - Check behavior matches REGISTRY.md documentation
- [ ] **Check standard error formula** - Confirm SE computation matches reference
- [ ] **Document any deviations** - Add notes explaining intentional differences with rationale

### When to Update This Document

1. **After completing a review**: Update status to "Complete" and add date
2. **When making corrections**: Document what was fixed in the "Corrections Made" section
3. **When identifying issues**: Add to "Outstanding Concerns" for future investigation
4. **When deviating from reference**: Document the deviation and rationale

### Deviation Documentation

When our implementation intentionally differs from the reference implementation, document:

1. **What differs**: Specific behavior or formula that differs
2. **Why**: Rationale (e.g., "defensive enhancement", "bug in R package", "follows updated paper")
3. **Impact**: Whether results differ in practice
4. **Cross-reference**: Update REGISTRY.md edge cases section

Example:
```
**Deviation (2025-01-15)**: CallawaySantAnna returns NaN for t_stat when SE is non-finite,
whereas R's `did::att_gt` would error. This is a defensive enhancement that provides
more graceful handling of edge cases while still signaling invalid inference to users.
```
