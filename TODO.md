## Code Quality

### Large Module Files

Target: < 1000 lines per module for maintainability.

### Tech Debt from Code Reviews

Deferred items from PR reviews that were not addressed before merge.

#### Methodology/Correctness

| Issue | Location | PR | Priority |
|-------|----------|----|----------|
| ImputationDiD dense `(A0'A0).toarray()` scales O((U+T+K)^2), OOM risk on large panels | `imputation.py` | #141 | Medium (deferred — only triggers when sparse solver fails; fixing requires sparse least-squares alternatives) |
| EfficientDiD: warn when cohort share is very small (< 2 units or < 1% of sample) — inverted in Omega*/EIF | `efficient_did_weights.py` | #192 | Low |
| EfficientDiD: API docs / tutorial page for new public estimator | `docs/` | #192 | Medium |
| Multi-absorb weighted demeaning needs iterative alternating projections for N > 1 absorbed FE with survey weights; unweighted multi-absorb also uses single-pass (pre-existing, exact only for balanced panels) | `estimators.py` | #218 | Medium |
| TripleDifference power: `generate_ddd_data` is a fixed 2×2×2 cross-sectional DGP — no multi-period or unbalanced-group support. Add a `generate_ddd_panel_data` for panel DDD power analysis. | `prep_dgp.py`, `power.py` | #208 | Low |

#### Performance

| Issue | Location | PR | Priority |
|-------|----------|----|----------|
| ImputationDiD event-study SEs recompute full conservative variance per horizon (should cache A0/A1 factorization) | `imputation.py` | #141 | Low |
| Rust faer SVD ndarray-to-faer conversion overhead (minimal vs SVD cost) | `rust/src/linalg.rs:67` | #115 | Low |

#### Testing/Docs

| Issue | Location | PR | Priority |
|-------|----------|----|----------|
| Tutorial notebooks not executed in CI | `docs/tutorials/*.ipynb` | #159 | Low |
| R comparison tests spawn separate `Rscript` per test (slow CI) | `tests/test_methodology_twfe.py:294` | #139 | Low |
| CS R helpers hard-code `xformla = ~ 1`; no covariate-adjusted R benchmark for IRLS path | `tests/test_methodology_callaway.py` | #202 | Low |
| ~~Context-dependent doc snippets pass via blanket NameError~~ | `tests/test_doc_snippets.py` | #206 | ~~Low~~ — resolved: allow-list replaces blanket catch |
| ~1,460 `duplicate object description` Sphinx warnings — each class attribute is documented in both module API pages and autosummary stubs; fix by adding `:no-index:` to one location or restructuring API docs to avoid overlap | `docs/api/*.rst`, `docs/api/_autosummary/` | — | Low |

### Standard Error Consistency

Different estimators compute SEs differently. Consider unified interface.

| Estimator | Default SE Type |
|-----------|-----------------|
| DifferenceInDifferences | HC1 or cluster-robust |
| TwoWayFixedEffects | Always cluster-robust (unit level) |
| CallawaySantAnna | Simple difference-in-means SE |
| SyntheticDiD | Bootstrap or placebo-based |

**Action**: Consider adding `se_type` parameter for consistency across estimators.

### Type Annotations

Mypy reports 9 errors (down from 81 before spring cleanup). All remaining are
mixin `attr-defined` errors — methods accessed via `self` that live on the
concrete class, not the mixin. Fixing these requires Protocol classes, which is
low priority.

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| attr-defined (mixin methods) | 9 | Structural — requires Protocol refactor |

**Resolved in spring cleanup:**
- [x] `@overload` on `solve_ols` / `_solve_ols_numpy` — eliminated all unpacking mismatches
- [x] `assert X is not None` guards — eliminated all Optional indexing errors
- [x] Mixin scalar attribute stubs — eliminated 26 mixin attr-defined errors
- [x] Matplotlib `tab10` lookup fix

## Deprecated Code

Deprecated parameters still present for backward compatibility:

- [x] `bootstrap_weight_type` in `CallawaySantAnna` (`staggered.py`)
  - Deprecated in favor of `bootstrap_weights` parameter
  - ✅ Deprecation warning updated to say "removed in v3.0"
  - ✅ README.md and tutorial 02 updated to use `bootstrap_weights`
  - Remove in next major version (v3.0)

## Test Coverage

**Note**: 21 visualization tests are skipped when matplotlib unavailable—this is expected.

---

## Honest DiD Improvements

Enhancements for `honest_did.py`:

- [ ] Improved C-LF implementation with direct optimization instead of grid search
- [ ] Support for CallawaySantAnnaResults (currently only MultiPeriodDiDResults)
- [ ] Event-study-specific bounds for each post-period
- [ ] Hybrid inference methods
- [ ] Simulation-based power analysis for honest bounds

---

## CallawaySantAnna Bootstrap Improvements

- [ ] Consider aligning p-value computation with R `did` package (symmetric percentile method)

## RuntimeWarnings in Linear Algebra Operations

### Apple Silicon M4 BLAS Bug (numpy < 2.3)

Spurious RuntimeWarnings ("divide by zero", "overflow", "invalid value") are emitted by `np.matmul`/`@` on Apple Silicon M4 + macOS Sequoia with numpy < 2.3. The warnings appear for matrices with ≥260 rows but **do not affect result correctness** — coefficients and fitted values are valid (no NaN/Inf), and the design matrices are full rank.

**Root cause**: Apple's BLAS SME (Scalable Matrix Extension) kernels corrupt the floating-point status register, causing spurious FPE signals. Tracked in [numpy#28687](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/28687) and [numpy#29820](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/29820). Fixed in numpy ≥ 2.3 via [PR #29223](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29223).

**Not reproducible** on M3, Intel, or Linux.

- [ ] `linalg.py:162` - Warnings in fitted value computation (`X @ coefficients`)
  - Caused by M4 BLAS bug, not extreme coefficient values
  - Seen in test_prep.py during treatment effect recovery tests (n > 260)
- [ ] `triple_diff.py:307,323` - Warnings in propensity score computation
  - Occurs in IPW and DR estimation methods with covariates
  - Related to logistic regression overflow in edge cases (separate from BLAS bug)

- **Long-term:** Revert to `@` operator when numpy ≥ 2.3 becomes the minimum supported version.

## Feature Gaps (from R `did` package comparison)

Features in R's `did` package that block porting additional tests:

| Feature | R tests blocked | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Repeated cross-sections (`panel=FALSE`) | ~7 tests in test-att_gt.R + test-user_bug_fixes.R | Medium |
| Sampling/population weights | 7 tests incl. all JEL replication | Medium |
| Calendar time aggregation | 1 test in test-att_gt.R | Low |

## Performance Optimizations

Potential future optimizations:

- [ ] JIT compilation for bootstrap loops (numba)
- [ ] Sparse matrix handling for large fixed effects

### QR+SVD Redundancy in Rank Detection

**Background**: The current `solve_ols()` implementation performs both QR (for rank detection) and SVD (for solving) decompositions on rank-deficient matrices. This is technically redundant since SVD can determine rank directly.

**Current approach** (R-style, chosen for robustness):
1. QR with pivoting for rank detection (`_detect_rank_deficiency()`)
2. scipy's `lstsq` with 'gelsd' driver (SVD-based) for solving

**Why we use QR for rank detection**:
- QR with pivoting provides the canonical ordering of linearly dependent columns
- R's `lm()` uses this approach for consistent dropped-column reporting
- Ensures consistent column dropping across runs (SVD column selection can vary)

**Potential optimization** (future work):
- Skip QR when `rank_deficient_action="silent"` since we don't need column names
- Use SVD rank directly in the Rust backend (already implemented)
- Add `skip_rank_check` parameter for hot paths where matrix is known to be full-rank (implemented in v2.2.0)

**Priority**: Low - the QR overhead is minimal compared to SVD solve, and correctness is more important than micro-optimization.

### Incomplete `check_finite` Bypass

**Background**: The `solve_ols()` function accepts a `check_finite=False` parameter intended to skip NaN/Inf validation for performance in hot paths where data is known to be clean.

**Current limitation**: When `check_finite=False`, our explicit validation is skipped, but scipy's internal QR decomposition in `_detect_rank_deficiency()` still validates finite values. This means callers cannot fully bypass all finite checks.

**Impact**: Minimal - the scipy check is fast and only affects edge cases where users explicitly pass `check_finite=False` with non-finite data (which would be a bug in their code anyway).

**Potential fix** (future work):
- Pass `check_finite=False` through to scipy's QR call (requires scipy >= 1.9.0)
- Or skip `_detect_rank_deficiency()` entirely when `check_finite=False` and `_skip_rank_check=True`

**Priority**: Low - this is an edge case optimization that doesn't affect correctness.
