diff-diff: Difference-in-Differences in Python
==============================================

**diff-diff** is a Python library for Difference-in-Differences (DiD) causal inference analysis.
It provides sklearn-like estimators with statsmodels-style output for econometric analysis.

.. code-block:: python

   from diff_diff import DifferenceInDifferences

   # Fit a basic DiD model
   did = DifferenceInDifferences()
   results = did.fit(data, outcome='y', treatment='treated', time='post')
   print(results.summary())

Key Features
------------

- **13+ Estimators**: Basic DiD, TWFE, Event Study, Synthetic DiD, plus modern staggered estimators (Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, Imputation, Two-Stage, Stacked DiD), advanced methods (TROP, Continuous DiD, Efficient DiD, Triple Difference), and Bacon Decomposition diagnostics
- **Modern Inference**: Robust standard errors, cluster-robust SEs, wild cluster bootstrap, and multiplier bootstrap
- **Assumption Testing**: Parallel trends tests, placebo tests, Bacon decomposition, and comprehensive diagnostics
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Honest DiD (Rambachan & Roth 2023) for robust inference under parallel trends violations
- **Built-in Datasets**: Real-world datasets from published studies (Card & Krueger, Castle Doctrine, and more)
- **High Performance**: Optional Rust backend for compute-intensive estimators like Synthetic DiD and TROP
- **Publication-Ready Output**: Summary tables, event study plots, and sensitivity analysis figures

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install diff-diff

For development:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install diff-diff[dev]

What is Difference-in-Differences?
----------------------------------

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is a quasi-experimental research design that estimates
causal treatment effects by comparing outcome changes over time between treated and
control groups. It is one of the most widely used methods in applied economics,
public policy evaluation, and social science research.

Why diff-diff?
--------------

- **Complete method coverage**: 13+ estimators from basic 2x2 DiD to cutting-edge methods like Efficient DiD (Chen et al. 2025) and TROP (Athey et al. 2025)
- **Familiar API**: sklearn-like ``fit()`` interface — if you know scikit-learn, you know diff-diff
- **Modern staggered methods**: Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, Imputation DiD, Two-Stage DiD, and Stacked DiD handle heterogeneous treatment timing correctly
- **Robust inference**: Heteroskedasticity-robust, cluster-robust, wild cluster bootstrap, and multiplier bootstrap
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Honest DiD (Rambachan & Roth 2023) for robust inference under parallel trends violations
- **Validated against R**: Benchmarked against ``did``, ``synthdid``, and ``fixest`` — see :doc:`benchmarks`
- **No heavy dependencies**: Only numpy, pandas, and scipy
