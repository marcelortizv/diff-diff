# Survey Data Support Roadmap

This document captures the survey data support roadmap for diff-diff.
All phases (1-6) are implemented.

## Implemented (Phases 1-2)

- **SurveyDesign** class with weights, strata, PSU, FPC, weight_type, nest, lonely_psu
- **Weighted OLS** via sqrt(w) transformation in `solve_ols()`
- **Weighted sandwich estimator** in `compute_robust_vcov()` (pweight/fweight/aweight)
- **Taylor Series Linearization** (TSL) variance with strata + PSU + FPC
- **Survey degrees of freedom**: n_PSU - n_strata
- **Base estimator integration**: DifferenceInDifferences, TwoWayFixedEffects, MultiPeriodDiD
- **Weighted demeaning**: `demean_by_group()` and `within_transform()` with weights
- **SurveyMetadata** in results objects with effective n, DEFF, weight_range

## Implemented (Phase 3): OLS-Based Standalone Estimators

| Estimator | File | Survey Support | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------------|-------|
| StackedDiD | `stacked_did.py` | pweight only | Q-weights compose multiplicatively with survey weights; TSL vcov on composed weights; fweight/aweight rejected (composition changes weight semantics) |
| SunAbraham | `sun_abraham.py` | Full | Survey weights in LinearRegression + weighted within-transform; bootstrap+survey deferred |
| BaconDecomposition | `bacon.py` | Diagnostic | Weighted cell means, weighted within-transform, weighted group shares; no inference (diagnostic only) |
| TripleDifference | `triple_diff.py` | Full | Regression, IPW, and DR methods with weighted OLS/logit + TSL on influence functions |
| ContinuousDiD | `continuous_did.py` | Analytical | Weighted B-spline OLS + TSL on influence functions; bootstrap+survey deferred |
| EfficientDiD | `efficient_did.py` | Analytical | Weighted means/covariances in Omega* + TSL on EIF scores; bootstrap+survey deferred |

### Phase 3 Deferred Work

The following capabilities were deferred from Phase 3 because they depend on
Phase 5 infrastructure (bootstrap+survey interaction):

| Estimator | Deferred Capability | Blocker |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| SunAbraham | Pairs bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| ContinuousDiD | Multiplier bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| EfficientDiD | Multiplier bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| EfficientDiD | Covariates (DR path) + survey | DR nuisance estimation needs survey weight threading |

All blocked combinations raise `NotImplementedError` when attempted, with a
message pointing to the planned phase or describing the limitation.

## Implemented (Phase 4): Complex Standalone Estimators + Weighted Logit

| Estimator | File | Survey Support | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------------|-------|
| ImputationDiD | `imputation.py` | Analytical | Weighted iterative FE, weighted ATT aggregation, weighted conservative variance (Theorem 3); bootstrap+survey deferred |
| TwoStageDiD | `two_stage.py` | Analytical | Weighted iterative FE, weighted Stage 2 OLS, weighted GMM sandwich variance; bootstrap+survey deferred |
| CallawaySantAnna | `staggered.py` | Weights-only | Weights-only SurveyDesign (strata/PSU/FPC rejected); reg supports covariates, IPW/DR no-covariate only; survey-weighted WIF in aggregation; full design SEs, covariates+IPW/DR, and bootstrap+survey deferred |

**Infrastructure**: Weighted `solve_logit()` added to `linalg.py` — survey weights
enter the IRLS working weights as `w_survey * mu * (1 - mu)`. This also unblocked
TripleDifference IPW/DR from Phase 3 deferred work.

### Phase 4 Deferred Work

| Estimator | Deferred Capability | Blocker |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| ImputationDiD | Bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| TwoStageDiD | Bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| CallawaySantAnna | Bootstrap + survey | Phase 5: bootstrap+survey interaction |
| CallawaySantAnna | Strata/PSU/FPC in SurveyDesign | Phase 5: route combined IF/WIF through `compute_survey_vcov()` for design-based aggregation SEs |
| CallawaySantAnna | Covariates + IPW/DR + survey | Phase 5: DRDID panel nuisance IF corrections |
| CallawaySantAnna | Efficient DRDID nuisance IF for reg+covariates | Phase 5: replace conservative plug-in IF with semiparametrically efficient IF |

## Implemented (Phase 5): SyntheticDiD + TROP Survey Support

| Estimator | File | Survey Support | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------------|-------|
| SyntheticDiD | `synthetic_did.py` | pweight | Both sides weighted (WLS interpretation): treated means survey-weighted, ω composed with control survey weights post-optimization. Placebo and bootstrap SE preserve survey weights. Covariates residualized with WLS. |
| TROP | `trop.py` | pweight | ATT aggregation only: population-weighted average of per-observation treatment effects. Model fitting (kernel weights, LOOCV, nuclear norm) unchanged. Rust and Python bootstrap paths both support weighted ATT. |

### Phase 5 Deferred Work

| Estimator | Deferred Capability | Blocker |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| SyntheticDiD | strata/PSU/FPC + survey-aware bootstrap | Bootstrap + Survey Interaction |
| TROP | strata/PSU/FPC + survey-aware bootstrap | Bootstrap + Survey Interaction |

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Bootstrap + Survey Interaction ✅ (2026-03-24)
Survey-aware bootstrap for all 8 bootstrap-using estimators. Two strategies:
- **Multiplier at PSU level** (CS, ImputationDiD, TwoStageDiD, ContinuousDiD,
  EfficientDiD): generate multiplier weights at PSU level within strata, FPC-scaled.
- **Rao-Wu rescaled** (SunAbraham, SyntheticDiD, TROP): draw PSUs within strata,
  rescale observation weights per Rao, Wu & Yue (1992).
- **CS analytical expansion**: strata/PSU/FPC now supported for aggregated SEs via
  `compute_survey_if_variance()`.
- **TROP**: cross-classified pseudo-strata (survey_stratum × treatment_group).
- **Rust TROP**: pweight-only in Rust; full design falls to Python path.

### Replicate Weight Variance ✅ (2026-03-26)
Re-run WLS for each replicate weight column, compute variance from distribution
of estimates. Supports BRR, Fay's BRR, JK1, JKn methods.
JKn requires explicit `replicate_strata` (per-replicate stratum assignment).
- `replicate_weights`, `replicate_method`, `fay_rho` fields on SurveyDesign
- `compute_replicate_vcov()` for OLS-based estimators (re-runs WLS per replicate)
- `compute_replicate_if_variance()` for IF-based estimators (reweights IF)
- Dispatch in `LinearRegression.fit()` and `staggered_aggregation.py`
- Replicate weights mutually exclusive with strata/PSU/FPC
- Survey df = R-1 for replicate designs

### DEFF Diagnostics ✅ (2026-03-26)
Per-coefficient design effects comparing survey vcov to SRS (HC1) vcov.
- `DEFFDiagnostics` dataclass with per-coefficient DEFF, effective n, SRS/survey SE
- `compute_deff_diagnostics()` standalone function
- `LinearRegression.compute_deff()` post-fit method
- Display label "Kish DEFF (weights)" for existing weight-based DEFF

### Subpopulation Analysis ✅ (2026-03-26)
`SurveyDesign.subpopulation(data, mask)` — zero-out weights for excluded
observations while preserving the full design structure for correct variance
estimation (unlike simple subsetting, which would drop design information).
- Mask: bool array/Series, column name, or callable
- Returns (SurveyDesign, DataFrame) pair with synthetic `_subpop_weight` column
- Weight validation relaxed: zero weights allowed (negative still rejected)
